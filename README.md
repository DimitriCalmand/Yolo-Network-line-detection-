# Yolo-Network-line-detection-
An implementation of YOLO for line detection that works well on our custom dataset. Results may vary on other datasets. We trained the network on a large set of images and it is capable of detecting lines in real-time. If you're working with a similar dataset, this network may be a good starting point for you.
